    cd ..

    docker-compose up --build -d
    
*[Optional]* You can either open a separate terminal and follow the logs while systems are initializing:
```
docker-compose logs -f
```
*[Optional]* Or check the starting status:
```
docker-compose ps
```

docker exec -it clickhouse-project_kafka_1 /usr/bin/kafka-console-producer   --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic events

{"type": "post_view","post_id": 50}
{"type": "post_view","post_id": 50}
{"type": "post_view","post_id": 50}
```

### fetch data via clickhouse http interface

```sh
