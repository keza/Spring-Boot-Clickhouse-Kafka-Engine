# Spring Boot + Kafka + Clickhouse

This is an example **Spring Boot + Apache Kafka + Clickhouse + kafdrop** app.

It was made using **Spring Boot**, **Clickhouse**, **Clickhouse Kafka Engine**, **Apache Kafka**, **Apache ZooKeeper**, **Spring Kafka**, **Docker**, **kafdrop** and **Docker Compose**.

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)
- [Docker]()


### Clone

Run the command below to clone the project:


```sh
git clone https://github.com/keza/Spring-Boot-Clickhouse-Kafka-Engine.git
```

### Run

Build Docker image:

We are using **Docker-Compose** to start the containers. Go to the root folder where 'docker-compose.yml' is located and run the below command:

    cd clickhouse-client
    
    mvn clean install -DskipTests
    
    cd ..

    docker-compose up --build -d
    
*[Optional]* You can either open a separate terminal and follow the logs while systems are initializing:
```
docker-compose logs -f
```
*[Optional]* Or check the starting status:
```
docker-compose ps
```
    
### Create Event

```sh
docker exec -it clickhouse-project_kafka_1 /usr/bin/kafka-console-producer   --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic events

{"type": "post_view","post_id": 50}
{"type": "post_view","post_id": 50}
{"type": "post_view","post_id": 50}
```

### fetch data via clickhouse http interface

```sh
curl --location --request GET 'localhost:8090/events/post/http/50'
```

### fetch data via clickhouse-native-jdbc

```sh
curl --location --request GET 'localhost:8090/events/post/jdbc/50'
```

### Kafdrop â€“ Kafka Web UI 

http://localhost:9005/

### Stop
Go to the root folder where is *docker-compose.yml*.

To stop all containers execute:
```
docker-compose down
```

### Clickhouse SQL

```sql
CREATE TABLE event_queue (
                                type String,
                                post_id Int32
)
    ENGINE = Kafka
        SETTINGS kafka_broker_list = 'kafka:9092',
            kafka_topic_list = 'events',
            kafka_group_name = 'events_consumer_group1',
            kafka_format = 'JSONEachRow',
            kafka_num_consumers = 3,
            kafka_thread_per_consumer = 1;
            
CREATE TABLE events (
                          type String,
                          post_id Int32,
                          _topic String,
                          _offset UInt64,
                          _partition UInt64,
                          _timestamp DateTime
) Engine = MergeTree()
   ORDER BY  (type, post_id)
     PRIMARY KEY (type, post_id);
     
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW event_queue_mv TO events AS
SELECT type, post_id, _topic, _offset, _partition, _timestamp
FROM event_queue;

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW events_count_mv
    Engine = SummingMergeTree()
        ORDER BY  (type, post_id)
    POPULATE
    AS SELECT
              type,
              post_id,
              count() as count
    FROM events
    GROUP BY (type, post_id);
```
